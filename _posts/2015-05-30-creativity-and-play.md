I've been thinking a lot about these two things recently because I believe they're incredibly important and I believe that they are, to a great extent, missing from most people's working lives.

I don't believe in work without play, I also don't believe that they're divisible. Each should enable the other and each suffers if the balance is not managed.

There's a fairly well known <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_on_creativity_and_play.html">TED talk by Tim Brown</a> (CEO of <a href="http://www.ideo.com/uk/">IDEO</a>) on the subject of creativity and play which explains why it's important to keep playing as an adult and have safe environments in which to do that.

I suspect most working environments these days don't provide the necessary stimulus to engender playful behaviour and creative solutions. Does this mean we're unable to solve problems? No. However, I do believe it means that we're perpetuating a working culture which stifles evolutionary development and our economies aren't as good as they could be. People are still developing new ideas and forging ahead with creative solutions, sure, but I think it's telling that it seems to be predominantly start-ups which are capable of this. Is it just easier to solve the problem by building a company culture from scratch than it is to evolve a new, playful culture in an existing organisation?

What I'm developing within myself, and part of the reason I've tried more to engage regularly with this blog, is a serious attention to research and play. There is so much to learn and so much to see, but sometimes I get bogged down in trying to understand what everyone else is doing. I need to develop a habit of exploring through doing rather than expecting that someone, somewhere will already have the answer for me and turning to the search engine instead. I suspect Google is making more and more of us lazy in that respect. 
We shouldn't be thinking about play simply as a problem solving exercise - it may result in us finding the solution, but I believe we also learn about ourselves and discover mental methods and routes around problems which no amount of reading and research will ever illuminate for us. As corny as it might sound, the light-bulb moment has to come from within, Google may seem like a short-cut, but it can't light the way ahead for you.
